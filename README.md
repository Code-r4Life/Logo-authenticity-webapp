# 🏷️ Logo Authenticity Web Application

### 👨‍💻 Developed by:  
**Shinjan Saha**

---

## 🧠 Project Overview

This web application verifies logo authenticity using a **CNN-based model**, performing **binary classification** (real vs. fake) and **multiclass classification** (brand detection) with **MobileNetV3 in TensorFlow**. A **custom dataset of over 3,000 images** was collected and augmented using **Google Teachable Machine** and image preprocessing techniques to overcome the lack of quality public datasets. The app currently supports top global brands like **Adidas, Nike, and Gucci** with high accuracy, and is designed to scale to additional brands.
